# Standard Library

These pages describe the Orchid modules included with the interpreter. Libraries under `std::` are fairly universal, but all of this may vary from environment to environment, possibly in subtle ways. For example, embedders may choose to reimplement part of the standard library in Rust for improved performance which the stock standalone interpreter defines in Orchid.
